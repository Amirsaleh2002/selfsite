        What happened that I became a frontend developer ?

      <p className="desc">
        When I entered university almost three years ago, I could say that I
        didn't have any goals of what I wanted to do in university. It was at
        the beginning of 1401 that this university became a full-time
        university. And I found my interest. My interest was website design. I
        have been working on the front end for 2 years and soon I will start
        deep learning of backend and at the same time I am looking at learning
        SEO.
